# Why use GitHub as a blog?

## Traditional HTML blogs

You may remember old HTML blogs, where the author simply puts new .html via FTP or something, and just uses links via a summary or "next" page, no database, no search, not even CSS. Unreadable? Just zoom. Search? Just use Ctrl+F while in the summary. Updates? Just send an email to the author and he will notify you of new posts.
